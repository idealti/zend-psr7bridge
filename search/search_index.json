To convert from a PSR-7 instance to a zend-http instance, use Zend\\Psr7Bridge\\Psr7ServerRequest::toZend() . This method takes up to two arguments: the ServerRequestInterface instance to convert. a boolean flag indicating whether or not to do a \"shallow\" conversion. Shallow conversions omit: body parameters (\"post\" in zend-http) uploaded files the body content It is useful to omit these for purposes of routing, for instance, when you may not need this more process-intensive data. By default, the $shallow flag is false , meaning a full conversion is done.
